Project Euler
=============

The problems here have been taken from the Project Euler (www.projecteuler.net).

Taken from the site:
"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming
problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve."


I advice you to not straight up copy the answer as the fun part in the problems
lie in figuring out the answers yourself! : )
